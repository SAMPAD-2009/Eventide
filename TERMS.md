**Terms and Conditions of Service**
Last Updated: *27 September 2025*

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms," "T&C") govern the usage of the **Eventide** application ("the Service") provided by **SAMP-2009** (hereinafter referred to as "the Developer").

By accessing or utilizing the Service, the user agrees to be legally bound by these Terms. Should the user dissent from any provision contained herein, access to the Service must be immediately terminated.

1. **CRITICAL DISCLAIMER**: Academic Project Status
The Service constitutes an academic and portfolio project developed by a student. It is furnished on an "as-is" basis, without any representation or warranty regarding reliability, security posture, or professional level of maintenance.

The user hereby acknowledges and accepts the following inherent **risks**:

*Software Defects and Anomalies*: The Service may incorporate non-optimized code, functional defects, and unforeseen anomalies that could potentially precipitate system instability, errors, or the temporary loss of data.

*Limited Testing Protocol*: This application has undergone a limited scope of testing and is thus not suitable for mission-critical operations or the storage of highly confidential data.

2. **API Permissions and Sensitive Data Protocol**
Where the Service necessitates external authentication or API integration (e.g., Google OAuth, access to electronic mail services, or other cloud APIs), users are required to exercise stringent prudence.

Users are strictly cautioned against granting this application highly sensitive or expansive permissions, including, but not limited to:

Full read/write access to the primary electronic mail account (e.g., Gmail).

Access to critical financial data, health records, or other highly private personal information.

All granted permissions and access are extended by the user at their sole risk. The Developer shall not be held liable for any data compromise, unauthorized system access, or pecuniary loss resulting from defects, security flaws, or misconfigurations inherent in this academic application.

3. **Data Storage and User Content Management***
All user-generated artifacts, including but not limited to events, tasks, and notes (collectively, "User Content"), are subject to transmission and storage on the Developer's designated server infrastructure.

While the Developer endeavors to implement reasonable data protection measures, given the nature of this academic endeavor, the Developer cannot guarantee the security integrity of the designated storage environment. Consequently, users must refrain from utilizing the Service for storing highly private or confidential information.

4. **Conditions of Service Use**
The user must satisfy a minimum age requirement of thirteen (13) years to utilize the Service.

The user retains full responsibility for all activities transacted under their account credentials.

The user stipulates that the Service shall not be employed for any unlawful or expressly prohibited activities.

The Developer reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to the Service immediately, without prior notification or assumption of liability, should the user be found in breach of these Terms.

5. **Limitation of Liability**
In no event shall **I**,*the developer*, nor its proprietor, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including, without limitation, loss of profits, data, utility, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising from:

The user's access to, use of, or inability to access or utilize the Service.

Any conduct or content produced by a third party on the Service.

Any unauthorized access, utilization, or alteration of the user's data transmissions or content, particularly concerning third-party API permissions or data access.

6. **Amendments to the Terms**
The Developer reserves the exclusive right, at its sole discretion, to modify or substitute these Terms at any time. Should a revision be deemed material, the Developer shall attempt to provide no less than thirty (30) days' notice prior to the new terms becoming effective. Continued access or use of the Service following the implementation of such revisions constitutes binding acceptance of the revised terms.
